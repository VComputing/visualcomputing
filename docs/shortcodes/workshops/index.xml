Background Sometimes your brain can change the colors of what you are seeing, based on the colors of surrounding the object, the moviing square illusion (https://petapixel.com/2022/08/03/the-square-in-this-optical-illusion-isnt-actually-changing-color/) show this. To recreate this illusion the following code was used as reference for the background: https://editor.p5js.org/Jaemi13/sketches/gAS-FB5Sx Conclusions The square seems to get darker as it goues up however if you check the code you can see that it is always the same shade of blur, the human eye can be tricked using surrounding colors.</description></item><item><title/><link>https://VComputing.github.io/visualcomputing/docs/shortcodes/workshops/visual_illusions/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://VComputing.github.io/visualcomputing/docs/shortcodes/workshops/visual_illusions/</guid><description>Visual Illusions # Problem Statement # Study, implement and discuss possible applications of some known visual phenomena and optical illusions.
